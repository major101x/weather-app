# Weather App
A website that lets you check the weather anywhere, using the Visual Crossing API.

# Lessons Learned
I learned about asynchronous JavaScript, async/await and promises.

I also learned how to fetch and parse data from APIs, as well as handle the different types of errors coming from a server.
